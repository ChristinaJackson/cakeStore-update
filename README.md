## Description
I coordinated the original version of this project because I wanted to gain experience developing collaboratively. I reached out to someone who I thought would be willing to participate. The current image is of the project after I did some redesign work.

## Project Brief
### Goal
Build a mock store front page. 

### My Contributions
On the original version I built the image grid, developed the high contrast mode for color accessibility, applied flex-box layout features to the header and footer as well as designing the footer. I added the filter on the products page as well as the feature to click out of cart area to close cart. Improved the positioning and design of color accessibility button. 

#### Partners Contributions
Implemented and adapted code for the cart from a tutorial found here: [Tutorial]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023Psne_-_4)
